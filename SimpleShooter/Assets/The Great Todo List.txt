- Add UI elements (ammo counts, weapons, cooldown since sound is a no-go)
- probably could have some sound though? might play with BFXR or something, mash something together.
- music, definitely. Some mixing. We have the technology.
- perhaps different levels?


if it seems like i'm over-achieving with this, it's because i've done alllll this before, but not nearly as neatly
think one of my earlier projects in Game Design WAS a first-person shooter just like this.
Faceplanted with the projectiles back then, but I have a handle on it now.
so yeah, still working on this
might take it and make a more-impressive game out of it for a portfolio piece after the project deadline
